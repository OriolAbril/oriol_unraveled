"I'm a physicist/engineer converted into a computational statistician. I "
"love statistical data analysis, programming and data visualization. I am "
"currently a doctoral researcher at [Helsinki "
"University](https://researchportal.helsinki.fi/en/persons/oriol-abril-"
"pla) working on AI assisted Bayesian workflow and contributing to open "
"source. I am a core contributor of [ArviZ](https://arviz-"
"devs.github.io/arviz/) a project for exploratory analysis of Bayesian "
"models. In addition to probabilistic modeling, I also enjoy teaching and "
"technical writing."

"I think that the culture in scientific research needs deep changes "
"towards a more collaborative, open and diverse model. I am interested in "
"open science, reproducible research and science communication. I want to "
"pursue a career in probabilistic modeling and statistical research with "
"special emphasis on openness and reproducibility."

"In my spare time, I like playing board games and going to the beach to do"
