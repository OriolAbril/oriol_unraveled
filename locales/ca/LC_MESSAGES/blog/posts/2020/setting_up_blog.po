"Writing the content using Markdown is one of the most common alternatives"

"fastpages uses the default Jekyll theme: "

"features and everything works straight away with fastpages, I wanted to "
"use a different theme, to give another look to the website and make it "

"specified in `_config.yml` for several new themes I found more visually "
"attractive. I found [basically basic](https://mmistakes.github.io/jekyll-"
"theme-basically-basic/) (see screenshots below) and "
"[massively](https://iwiedenm.github.io/jekyll-theme-massively/) to work "
"quite well right out of the box. Most of the themes did not work at all "
"due to incompatibilities with fastpages. After comparing both themes for "
"a while, I decided to go with massively. I therefore tweaked the theme to"
" fix the minor incompatibilities it presented with fastpages. This is "
"still a work in progress, not everything that works with fastpages+minima"
