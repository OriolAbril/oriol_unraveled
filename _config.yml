# you can comment the below line out if your repo name is not different than your baseurl
github_repo: "oriol_unraveled"

# OPTIONAL: override baseurl and url if using a custom domain
# Note: leave out the trailing / from this value.
url: "https://oriolabrilpla.cat" # the base hostname & protocol for your site, e.g. http://example.com

###########################################################
#########  Special Instructions for baseurl ###############
#
#### Scenario One: If you do not have a Custom Domain #####
#    -  if you are not using a custom domain, the baseurl *must* be set to your repo name
#
####  Scenario Two: If you have a Custom Domain #####
# 1. If your domain does NOT have a subpath, this leave this value as ""
# 2. If your domain does have a subpath, you must preceed the value with a / and NOT have a / at the end.
#      For example:
#           "" is valid
#           "/blog"        is valid
#            "/blog/site/" is invalid  ( / at the end)
#            "/blog/site"  is valid
#            "blog/site"   is invalid  ( because doesn't begin with a /)
#
# 3. You must replace the parameter `baseurl` in _action_files/settings.ini with the same value as you set here but WITHOUT QUOTES.
#
baseurl: "" # the subpath of your site, e.g. "/blog".
