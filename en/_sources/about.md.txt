# About me

I'm a physicist/engineer converted into a computational statistician.
I love statistical data analysis, programming and data visualization.
I am a core contributor of {doc}`ArviZ <arviz_org:index>` a project for exploratory
analysis of Bayesian models. In addition to probabilistic
modeling, I also enjoy teaching and technical writing.

I think that the culture in scientific research needs deep changes towards a
more collaborative, open and diverse model. I am interested in open science,
reproducible research and science communication. I want to pursue a career in
probabilistic modeling and statistical research with special emphasis on
openness and reproducibility.

In my spare time, I like playing board games and going to the beach to do
water activities. I have been sailing and snorkeling regularly since I was
little and more recently I added kayaking to the mix too! I generally spend
the summer at the _Costa Brava_. Here I leave you a sneak peak of the views
when nobody is around

When you support me directly you are both
helping me dedicate time to the open source projects I contribute to
and sustaining this blog and other personal projects.

If you or your company prefers supporting the open source projects directly,
you can also do so through NumFOCUS:

When donating to ArviZ or PyMC, you are supporting me indirectly,
along with the rest of the people who make these libraries possible.

If you or your company use open source and have the means to do so, please consider donating somehow.
We need some financial support to make sure open source is sustainable.
