title: About Me

I'm a physicist/engineer converted into a computational statistician.
I love statistical data analysis, programming and data visualization.
I am currently a doctoral researcher at [Helsinki University](https://researchportal.helsinki.fi/en/persons/oriol-abril-pla)
working on AI assisted Bayesian workflow and contributing to open source.
I am a core contributor of
[ArviZ](https://arviz-devs.github.io/arviz/) a project for exploratory
analysis of Bayesian models. In addition to probabilistic
modeling, I also enjoy teaching and technical writing.

I think that the culture in scientific research needs deep changes towards a
more collaborative, open and diverse model. I am interested in open science,
reproducible research and science communication. I want to pursue a career in
probabilistic modeling and statistical research with special emphasis on
openness and reproducibility.

In my spare time, I like playing board games and going to the beach to do
water activities. I have been sailing and snorkeling regularly since I was
little and more recently I added kayaking to the mix too! I generally spend
the summer at the _Costa Brava_. Here I leave you a sneak peak of the views
when nobody is around
