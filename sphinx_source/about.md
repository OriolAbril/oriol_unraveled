# About me

I'm a physicist/engineer converted into a computational statistician.
I love statistical data analysis, programming and data visualization.
I am a core contributor of
[ArviZ](https://www.arviz.org) a project for exploratory
analysis of Bayesian models. In addition to probabilistic
modeling, I also enjoy teaching and technical writing.

I think that the culture in scientific research needs deep changes towards a
more collaborative, open and diverse model. I am interested in open science,
reproducible research and science communication. I want to pursue a career in
probabilistic modeling and statistical research with special emphasis on
openness and reproducibility.

In my spare time, I like playing board games and going to the beach to do
water activities. I have been sailing and snorkeling regularly since I was
little and more recently I added kayaking to the mix too! I generally spend
the summer at the _Costa Brava_. Here I leave you a sneak peak of the views
when nobody is around

## Academic work and publications
I have also worked as doctoral researcher and research assistant,
at Helsinki University and at Universitat Pompeu Fabra respectively.
Here are some publications I have helped a bit with:

* Mikkola, Petrus, et al. "Prior knowledge elicitation: The past, present, and future." _arXiv preprint arXiv:2112.01380_ (2021).
* Rossell, David, Oriol Abril, and Anirban Bhattacharya. "Approximate Laplace approximations for scalable model selection."
  _Journal of the Royal Statistical Society: Series B (Statistical Methodology)_ 83.4 (2021): 853-879.
* Badenas-Agusti, Mariona, et al. "HD 191939: Three Sub-Neptunes Transiting a Sun-like Star Only 54 pc Away."
  _The Astronomical Journal_ 160.3 (2020): 113.
* Foreman-Mackey, Daniel, et al. "emcee v3: A Python ensemble sampling toolkit for affine-invariant MCMC."
  _arXiv preprint arXiv:1911.07688_ (2019).

When donating to ArviZ or PyMC, you are supporting me indirectly,
along with the rest of the people who make these libraries possible.

If you use open source and have the means to do so, please consider donating somehow.
We need some financial support to make sure open source is sustainable.
