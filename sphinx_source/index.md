A well known Catalan saying goes: "Xerrar pels descosits". It means that somebody talks too much. "xerrar" is talking and a "descosit" refers to pieces of fabric that have come undone or been unraveled. I generally do not talk too much, in fact I tend to talk too little unless we are talking about topics such as statistics or programming. I hope this blog can be a place to unravel concepts on statistics, open source and programming, allowing me to "xerrar pels descosits" in blog version.

Get ready for some puns and let's dive in!
