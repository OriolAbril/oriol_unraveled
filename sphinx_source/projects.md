## Open source libraries
Here are highlighted some open source projects I contribute to, check out my
[GitHub profile](https://github.com/OriolAbril) for a complete list
of the projects I contribute to.

* [**ArviZ**](https://github.com/arviz-devs/arviz): Exploratory analysis of
  Bayesian models in [Python](https://arviz-devs.github.io/arviz/index.html)
  or [Julia](https://arviz-devs.github.io/ArviZ.jl/stable/)
* [**xarray-einstats**](https://xarray-einstats.readthedocs.io/en/latest):
  Label based statistics, linear algebra and einops for xarray objects.
* [**PyMC**](https://www.pymc.io): Friendly probabilistic programming in Python.
  - In addition to helping a bit with PyMC development, I am one of the main curator/reviewers
    of [PyMC-examples](https://docs.pymc.io/projects/examples/en/latest/),
    a collection of Jupyter notebooks about Bayesian modeling with PyMC.
* [**mombf**](https://github.com/davidrusi/mombf): Bayesian model selection and
  averaging for regression and mixtures for non-local and local priors.
* [**exosherlock**](https://github.com/mbadenas/exosherlock): Smooth
  your interactions with the NASA Exoplanet Archive using Python and pandas.

* [**PyMC-Data Umbrella sprint**](https://pymc-data-umbrella.xyz/en/latest):
  A series of webinars and sprint event to encourage and help people contribute to PyMC.
* [**Season of Docs at ArviZ**](https://arviz-gsod.readthedocs.io/en/latest/):
  [GSoD](https://developers.google.com/season-of-docs/) is an initiative to help
  open source projects get in contact and hire technical writers.
